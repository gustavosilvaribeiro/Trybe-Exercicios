          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            The mantis shrimp is not a shrimp, and except for the fact that it's
            an arthropod, it's not related to the praying mantis, either.
            Instead, mantis shrimps are 500 different species belonging to the
            order Stomatopoda. To distinguish them from true shrimp, mantis
            shrimps are sometimes called stomatopods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mantis shrimps are known for their powerful claws, which they use to
            bludgeon or stab their prey. In addition to their fierce hunting
            method, mantis shrimps are also known for their extraordinary sense
            of sight.

          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            Stomatopods have
            <strong>the most complex vision in the animal kingdom</strong>, even
            exceeding that of butterflies. The mantis shrimp has compound eyes
            mounted on stalks, and can swivel them independently of one another
            to survey its surroundings. While humans have three types of
            photoreceptors, a mantis shrimp's eyes have between 12 and 16 types
            of photoreceptor cells. Some species can even tune the sensitivity
            of their color vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cluster of photoreceptors, called ommatidia, are arranged in
            parallel rows into three regions. This gives each eye depth
            perception and trinocular vision. Mantis shrimps can perceive
            wavelengths from deep ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and
            into far red. They can also see polarized light. Some species can
            perceive circularly polarized light—an ability not found in any
            other animal species. Their exceptional vision gives the mantis
            shrimp a survival advantage in an environment that can range from
            bright to murky and allows them to see and gauge distance to
            shimmering or translucent objects.

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>
            Mantis shrimps are <strong>highly intelligent</strong>. They
            recognize and remember other individuals by sight and smell, and
            they demonstrate an ability to learn. The animals have a complex
            social behavior, which includes ritualized fighting and coordinated
            activities between members of a monogamous pair. They use
            fluorescent patterns to signal each other and possibly other
            species.

          <h3>Predators</h3>
          <p>
            As zooplankton, newly hatched and juvenile mantis shrimp are eaten
            by a variety of animals, including jellyfish, fish, and baleen
            whales. As adults, stomatopods have few predators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several species of mantis shrimp are eaten as seafood. Their meat is
            closer in flavor to lobster than shrimp. In many places, eating them
            carries the usual risks associated with eating seafood from
            contaminated waters.
